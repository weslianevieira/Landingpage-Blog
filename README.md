<h2 id="project">üíª Project</h2>

Hello! Welcome! I'm excited to present to you my website development project for "Oriental Fisio", a physiotherapy clinic located in Bras√≠lia/DF. As part of my work as a freelancer, I took the opportunity to enhance my skills in full-stack programming.

The main objective of this project is to provide clinic visitors with a pleasant experience that allows them to connect with the brand and the services offered. The website has been designed to facilitate the exchange of knowledge between patients and the physiotherapist through a regularly updated **blog**, and a static **landingpage** with information about the treatment and the clinic itself.
